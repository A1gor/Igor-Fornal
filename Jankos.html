                <h2 id="biografia">Biography</h2>
                <p>After spending time playing Warcraft 3 and DOTA, Jankos decided to take up League of Legends in Season 1. Due to the fact that he began playing on the NA server from his native Poland, he could not play competitively for a considerable
                    time. After praise and encouragement from IWillDominate, Jankos decided to start playing on the EU server along with his friends.
                </p>
                <h3>Season 3</h3>
                <p>After impressing in soloqueue, Jankos soon found himself on the roster of Team Mistral. The team went on to place 3rd at the LCS Summer Promotion Qualifier - Lille. Soon after this, Jankos was picked up by GF-Gaming along with the rest
                    of the Team Mistral roster. After success in a number of Go4LoL tournaments, Jankos went on to join H2k-Gaming, where he met Overpow and VandeR. Soon after joining H2k, Jankos and his new team won DreamHack Bucharest 2013, beating
                    the Copenhagen Wolves in the final. The team also managed to qualify for the Spring Promotion via the 1st WellPlayed Qualifier. The roster was then picked up by GF-Gaming, Jankos' former team, but was released just a week later. The
                    team decided to reform as Kiedyś Miałem Team, and went on to finish 2nd at DreamHack Winter 2013. Jankos and the team participated in the Spring Promotion using the spot they had earned with with H2k. The team finished 3rd in their
                    group, and went on to win their promotion matchup against Ninjas in Pyjamas.</p>
                <h3>Season 4</h3>
                <p>Now with a spot in the upcoming Spring Split, Jankos and the rest of the roster were signed by Team ROCCAT. The team's first split in the LCS was a huge success. ROCCAT spent 3 weeks at the top of the standings table mid-split, but results
                    tailed off slightly towards the end of the split. The team ended up finishing 4th behind Alliance, securing themselves a spot in the Spring Playoffs. ROCCAT performed well in the Spring Playoffs, but lost to SK Gaming in the semifinals.
                    The team went on to finish in 3rd place after beating Alliance in the third-place match. The Summer Split was a struggle for ROCCAT, with the team not once making it out of the bottom 3 of the standings table. A frustrating few weeks
                    at the start of the split were followed by an overall improvement in the team's performances. Jankos managed to pick up a weekly MVP award for Week 8, specifically for his performances on Lee SinSquare.png Lee Sin and ViSquare.png
                    Vi against SK Gaming and Alliance respectively. Despite their struggles, ROCCAT placed 6th overall, clinching a place at the Summer Playoffs. The playoffs saw the team raise their game considerably. A quarterfinal win over SUPA HOT
                    CREW resulted in a semifinal matchup against Fnatic. The series was unexpectedly tight, with ROCCAT coming close but eventually losing 3-2 and missing out on qualification for the World Championship. A third-place match loss against
                    SK Gaming meant that ROCCAT finished 4th overall.

                </p>
                <h3>Season 5</h3>
                <p>Due to Fnatic being unable to attend IEM Cologne, Jankos and ROCCAT took their place at the tournament. The team were knocked out in the semifinals, losing to Counter Logic Gaming. Jankos and the team had an unsuccessful LCS Spring Split,
                    finishing the regular season in 8th place, which meant that they would play in the Summer Promotion. Here, the team faced Copenhagen Wolves Academy and came out victorious, securing their spot in the Summer Split. The Summer Split
                    itself was far more successful for Jankos and the team, finishing the regular season in 5th place partly thanks to Jankos' impressive performances on a number of champions. This meant they would qualify for the Summer Playoffs, where
                    the team were beaten in the quarterfinals by Unicorns Of Love, meaning that they would pick up 20 Championship Points and go on to play in the 2015 Season Europe Regional Finals. Team ROCCAT went on to lose to eventual qualifiers Origen
                    in Round 2 of the gauntlet.</p>
                <h3>Season 6</h3>
                <p>At the start of the season, Jankos joined H2k-Gaming after the team were voted to play at IEM Season X - Cologne. They fielded a roster including Odoamne and Ryu from their 2015 roster along with new members Jankos, FORG1VEN, and VandeR.
                    The team beat Cloud9 in the quarterfinals but were then beaten themselves by eventual winners Ever in the semifinals of the tournament.</p>
