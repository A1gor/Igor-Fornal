                <h2 id="biografia">Biography</h2>
                <p>TheShy was a member of Anarchy in 2014, but in November he joined Team WE as a streamer. He stayed with them until May of 2017, when he left and joined Invictus Gaming as their alternate top laner. The team's Summer Season was similar
                    to their Spring Season and they finished 3rd with a 10-6 record. They did much better in the playoffs and finished 3rd with a victory over Team WE in the third place match. IG then participated in the 2017 Season China Regional Finals,
                    but failed to make it to Worlds after Team WE got their revenge against them and beat them 3-2.
                </p>
                <h3>Season 8</h3>
                <p>TheShy and iG kick-started their season with a 3rd place finish in the Demacia Championship, losing 2-1 to Snake Esports in the loser's semifinal. Just two weeks later saw the start of the LPL Spring Season. Despite a regular season series
                    record of 18-1, with their only loss being against Royal Never Give Up, this did not translate into success in the Spring Playoffs. With TheShy himself sidelined due to a hand injury, Invictus Gaming were defeated 3-2 by RNG in the
                    semifinals, this being followed by a 3-1 loss at the hands of Rogue Warriors in the third-place match. Although their performance could be considered a disappointment, their placement secured them a spot at Rift Rivals 2018. A 3rd
                    place finish in the Demacia Cup, this time losing to Bilibili Gaming in the loser's semifinal without TheShy, was followed by a successful showing at Rift Rivals. Now recovered from his hand injury, TheShy and the team won both of
                    their group stage games, helping the LPL to an eventual triumph over the LCK in the final. Invictus Gaming once again achieved an 18-1 regular season record in the LPL Summer Season, their sole loss again to RNG. Despite the similarity
                    of the year's regular season performances, a successful showing in the Summer Playoffs, finishing runner-up to Royal Never Give Up after a tight 3-2 series, resulted in the team's qualification to the 2018 Season World Championship
                    on points. Invictus Gaming was placed in Group D for Worlds 2018, alongside Fnatic, 100 Thieves, and G-Rex. The group stage round robin concluded with iG and Fnatic tied for 1st place at 5-1. The tiebreaker went in the favor of Fnatic,
                    resulting in TheShy and the team being drawn against KT Rolster in the quarterfinals. A tense affair saw iG emerge victorious 3-2 and progress to the semifinals where they met G2 Esports. A more straightforward 3-0 series secured them
                    a place in the finals. Awaiting their challenge were Group D counterparts, Fnatic. Invictus Gaming's convincing performance in the finals resulted in a 3-0 victory, and made them the first Chinese team to win a World Championship.</p>
                <h3>Season 9</h3>
                <p>TheShy and iG started the season with a strong showing in the LPL, placing 2nd in the LPL Spring Season en route to their first domestic win in the organization's history. TheShy and iG win 3-0 against JD Gaming in the finals, qualifying
                    iG for the 2019 Mid-Season Invitational. TheShy was named the Finals MVP of the 2019 Spring Split.
