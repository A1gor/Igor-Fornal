                <h2 id="biografia">Biography</h2>
                <p>Kim "Doinb" Tae-sang (Hangul: 김태상) is a League of Legends esports player, currently mid laner for FunPlus Phoenix.
                </p>

                <p>Doinb is a high-elo solo queue mid laner from Korea. Even praised highly by the likes of Faker, he was recognized as a solo queue talent before being picked up by QG in the middle of the LSPL 2015 Spring Split debuting his skill on Katarina.
                    QG were invited to IEM Katowice in March 2016 where they beat Fnatic in their first best of one but were then subsequently eliminated in the group stages following a loss to SK Telecom T1 and then losing to Fnatic 1 - 2. In May 2016,
                    Qiao Gu Reapers renamed to Newbee.[20] Doinb was quickly moved to Newbee Young after there was internal conflict within the team between him and Swift. The team eventually fought their way through the LSPL and qualified for the LPL.
                    Per LPL rules they were re-branded into the QG Reapers in November of 2016. QG placed 3rd in their group in the 2017 LPL Spring Season however in the playoffs they lost 2-3 to I May in the first round. JD Gaming acquired the roster
                    and LPL spot of QG in May of 2017 with Doinb also joining the newly formed squad. Their first showing was at the 2017 Demacia Cup but it wasn't particularly good as they placed 9th-12th after an 0-2 loss to LGD Gaming. In the 2017
                    LPL Summer Season JD Gaming finished 5th in Group B with 6 wins and 11 losses which eliminated them from playoff contention. They also placed 2nd at the National Electronic Sports Tournament 2017.</p>
